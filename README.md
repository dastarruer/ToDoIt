##Overview
ToDoIt is a Flask app that allows users to register, login, and add their own tasks. These tasks can be either complete, or uncomplete, but they can never be deleted. While it is a pretty bare-bones to-do list app, this was really for me to learn about handling multiple users, which I'm pleased to report has turned out well.
